# GitHub Organization Permissions Required

## Issue: Can't See Developer Settings

If you can't see "Developer settings" in your GitHub organization, it's a **permissions issue**.

---

## Required Permissions

To create OAuth Apps and GitHub Apps for an organization, you need:

- **Owner** role, OR
- **Admin** role with "Manage organization settings" permission

---

## How to Check Your Permissions

### Step 1: Check Your Role

1. Go to: `https://github.com/organizations/OpenKPIs/people`
2. Find your username
3. Check your role:
   - ✅ **Owner** = Full access
   - ✅ **Member** with Admin permissions = May have access
   - ❌ **Member** = No access to developer settings

### Step 2: Check Organization Settings Access

1. Go to: `https://github.com/organizations/OpenKPIs/settings/profile`
2. Look at the left sidebar
3. If you see **"Developer settings"** → ✅ You have access
4. If you DON'T see it → ❌ You need higher permissions

---

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Get Organization Owner to Grant Permissions

**Ask an organization owner to:**

1. Go to: `https://github.com/organizations/OpenKPIs/settings/member_privileges`
2. Find your username
3. Change your role to **"Owner"** or grant **"Admin"** with full permissions

**OR**

1. Go to: `https://github.com/organizations/OpenKPIs/settings/roles`
2. Create a custom role with "Manage organization settings" permission
3. Assign that role to you

### Solution 2: Create Apps Under Personal Account (Temporary)

**⚠️ NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PRODUCTION**

If you can't get organization permissions, you can temporarily create apps under your personal account:

1. Go to: `https://github.com/settings/developers/oauth_apps`
2. Create OAuth Apps there
3. **Note:** These will show your personal name during login (not organization name)
4. **Later:** Transfer to organization when you get permissions

### Solution 3: Organization Owner Creates Apps

**Best Option:** Have an organization owner create the apps:

1. Organization owner follows the migration guide
2. Shares the credentials with you
3. You configure them in Supabase and Vercel

---

## Alternative: Check Organization Settings Structure

Sometimes the URL structure varies. Try these:

### For OAuth Apps:
- `https://github.com/organizations/OpenKPIs/settings/developers/oauth_apps`
- `https://github.com/organizations/OpenKPIs/settings/apps/oauth_apps`

### For GitHub Apps:
- `https://github.com/organizations/OpenKPIs/settings/developers/github_apps`
- `https://github.com/organizations/OpenKPIs/settings/apps/github_apps`

### General Developer Settings:

## Issue: Can't See Developer Settings

If you can't see "Developer settings" in your GitHub organization, it's a **permissions issue**.

---

## Required Permissions

To create OAuth Apps and GitHub Apps for an organization, you need:

- **Owner** role, OR
- **Admin** role with "Manage organization settings" permission

---

## How to Check Your Permissions

### Step 1: Check Your Role

1. Go to: `https://github.com/organizations/OpenKPIs/people`
2. Find your username
3. Check your role:
   - ✅ **Owner** = Full access
   - ✅ **Member** with Admin permissions = May have access
   - ❌ **Member** = No access to developer settings

### Step 2: Check Organization Settings Access

1. Go to: `https://github.com/organizations/OpenKPIs/settings/profile`
2. Look at the left sidebar
3. If you see **"Developer settings"** → ✅ You have access
4. If you DON'T see it → ❌ You need higher permissions

---

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Get Organization Owner to Grant Permissions

**Ask an organization owner to:**

1. Go to: `https://github.com/organizations/OpenKPIs/settings/member_privileges`
2. Find your username
3. Change your role to **"Owner"** or grant **"Admin"** with full permissions

**OR**

1. Go to: `https://github.com/organizations/OpenKPIs/settings/roles`
2. Create a custom role with "Manage organization settings" permission

2. Create OAuth Apps there
3. **Note:** These will show your personal name during login (not organization name)
4. **Later:** Transfer to organization when you get permissions

### Solution 3: Organization Owner Creates Apps

**Best Option:** Have an organization owner create the apps:

1. Organization owner follows the migration guide
2. Shares the credentials with you
3. You configure them in Supabase and Vercel

2. Create OAuth Apps there
3. **Note:** These will show your personal name during login (not organization name)
4. **Later:** Transfer to organization when you get permissions

### Solution 3: Organization Owner Creates Apps

**Best Option:** Have an organization owner create the apps:

1. Organization owner follows the migration guide
2. Shares the credentials with you
3. You configure them in Supabase and Vercel

- **Admin** role with "Manage organization settings" permission

---

## How to Check Your Permissions

### Step 1: Check Your Role

1. Go to: `https://github.com/organizations/OpenKPIs/people`
2. Find your username
3. Check your role:
   - ✅ **Owner** = Full access
   - ✅ **Member** with Admin permissions = May have access
   - ❌ **Member** = No access to developer settings

### Step 2: Check Organization Settings Access

1. Go to: `https://github.com/organizations/OpenKPIs/settings/profile`
2. Look at the left sidebar
3. If you see **"Developer settings"** → ✅ You have access
4. If you DON'T see it → ❌ You need higher permissions

---

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Get Organization Owner to Grant Permissions

**Ask an organization owner to:**

1. Go to: `https://github.com/organizations/OpenKPIs/settings/member_privileges`
2. Find your username
3. Change your role to **"Owner"** or grant **"Admin"** with full permissions

**OR**

1. Go to: `https://github.com/organizations/OpenKPIs/settings/roles`
2. Create a custom role with "Manage organization settings" permission
3. Assign that role to you

### Solution 2: Create Apps Under Personal Account (Temporary)

**⚠️ NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PRODUCTION**

If you can't get organization permissions, you can temporarily create apps under your personal account:

1. Go to: `https://github.com/settings/developers/oauth_apps`
2. Create OAuth Apps there
3. **Note:** These will show your personal name during login (not organization name)
4. **Later:** Transfer to organization when you get permissions

### Solution 3: Organization Owner Creates Apps

**Best Option:** Have an organization owner create the apps:

1. Organization owner follows the migration guide
2. Shares the credentials with you
3. You configure them in Supabase and Vercel

## Issue: Can't See Developer Settings

If you can't see "Developer settings" in your GitHub organization, it's a **permissions issue**.

---

## Required Permissions

To create OAuth Apps and GitHub Apps for an organization, you need:

- **Owner** role, OR
- **Admin** role with "Manage organization settings" permission

---

## How to Check Your Permissions

### Step 1: Check Your Role

1. Go to: `https://github.com/organizations/OpenKPIs/people`
2. Find your username
3. Check your role:
   - ✅ **Owner** = Full access
   - ✅ **Member** with Admin permissions = May have access
   - ❌ **Member** = No access to developer settings

### Step 2: Check Organization Settings Access

1. Go to: `https://github.com/organizations/OpenKPIs/settings/profile`
2. Look at the left sidebar
3. If you see **"Developer settings"** → ✅ You have access
4. If you DON'T see it → ❌ You need higher permissions

---

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Get Organization Owner to Grant Permissions

**Ask an organization owner to:**

1. Go to: `https://github.com/organizations/OpenKPIs/settings/member_privileges`
2. Find your username
3. Change your role to **"Owner"** or grant **"Admin"** with full permissions

**OR**

1. Go to: `https://github.com/organizations/OpenKPIs/settings/roles`
2. Create a custom role with "Manage organization settings" permission
3. Assign that role to you

### Solution 2: Create Apps Under Personal Account (Temporary)

**⚠️ NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PRODUCTION**

If you can't get organization permissions, you can temporarily create apps under your personal account:

1. Go to: `https://github.com/settings/developers/oauth_apps`
2. Create OAuth Apps there
3. **Note:** These will show your personal name during login (not organization name)
4. **Later:** Transfer to organization when you get permissions

### Solution 3: Organization Owner Creates Apps

**Best Option:** Have an organization owner create the apps:

1. Organization owner follows the migration guide
2. Shares the credentials with you
3. You configure them in Supabase and Vercel

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Get Organization Owner to Grant Permissions

**Ask an organization owner to:**

1. Go to: `https://github.com/organizations/OpenKPIs/settings/member_privileges`
2. Find your username
3. Change your role to **"Owner"** or grant **"Admin"** with full permissions

**OR**

1. Go to: `https://github.com/organizations/OpenKPIs/settings/roles`
2. Create a custom role with "Manage organization settings" permission
3. Assign that role to you

### Solution 2: Create Apps Under Personal Account (Temporary)

**⚠️ NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PRODUCTION**

If you can't get organization permissions, you can temporarily create apps under your personal account:

2. Create OAuth Apps there
3. **Note:** These will show your personal name during login (not organization name)
4. **Later:** Transfer to organization when you get permissions

### Solution 3: Organization Owner Creates Apps

**Best Option:** Have an organization owner create the apps:

1. Organization owner follows the migration guide
2. Shares the credentials with you
3. You configure them in Supabase and Vercel
